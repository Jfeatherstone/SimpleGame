# TextAdventure

Starting a new project, this one will be a less graphics intensive game (as opposed to Dungeon-Crawler) meaning that it will *hopefully* be cleaner. No idea about the story at this point, but looking for turn-based combat, with random loot (will probably be borrowed from Dungeon-Crawler)

All pixel art will be original and should be on my [piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/user/4977014434955264) (might change at some point)

Rough outline of what will be in the game:

    -UI
  
      -Game window with simple graphics (shown below)
        -Context Window
        
            -List drops, events, dialogue, etc.
            
            -Will also show stats and weapon descriptions
        
        -Graphical Window
        
            -Shows basic game, maze-like rooms with enemies that have fixed paths
        
        -Inventory Window
        
            -Shows items
        
        -Combat Window
        
            -Shows user skills and health bars    
    
    -Gameplay
  
      -Turn based combat based on skill level and weapon
    
      -Each weapon/type would have different attacks / skills
    
      -Random loot drops from enemies
    
      -Bosses every now and again, somehow implemented in a consistent fasion
      
      -Equipment includes two weapons, armor, headpiece, and power source
    
    -Story
  
      -Something about a hacker or something
    
What the basic GUI looks like:
