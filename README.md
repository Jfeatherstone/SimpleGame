# TextAdventure

Starting a new project, this one will be a less graphics intensive game (as opposed to Dungeon-Crawler) meaning that it will *hopefully* be cleaner. No idea about the story at this point, but looking for turn-based combat, with random loot (will probably be borrowed from Dungeon-Crawler)

All pixel art will be original and should be on my [piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/user/4977014434955264) (might change at some point)

Rough outline of what will be in the game:

    -UI
  
      -Game window with simple graphics
    
      -Text window to display what's going on in the game
    
        -List drops, events, dialogue, etc.
      
      -Maybe a stats screen or something to display equipment and character
    
      -An action panel to decide what to do (fight, talk, etc.)
    
    -Gameplay
  
      -Turn based combat based on level, weapon
    
      -Each weapon/type would have different attacks
    
      -Random loot drops from enemies
    
      -Bosses every now and again, somehow implemented in a consistent fasion
    
    -Story
  
      -No clue here
